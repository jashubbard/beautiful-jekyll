title: About me
---

I am currently a doctoral candidate at the University of Oregon, working in Ulrich Mayr’s Cognitive Dynamics Lab. Broadly, I am interested in the mechanisms underlying executive control and decision making, and the specific ways these change over the lifespan. I also have a specific interest in Neuroeconomics and altruistic decision making. Recent work in our lab has identified a "general benevolence" dimension that reflects a pure concern for others' well-being, a dimension that appears to increase across the lifespan. 

I enjoy the opportunity to employ diverse methods in my work, having experience with behavioral data, eyetracking, pupillometry, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), structural MRI, functional MRI, EEG, and most recently cardiac measures. Whenever possible I try to utilize a breadth of statistical methods to these data, including multilevel modelling, latent variable analyses (SEM), and multivariate decoding. I also have a strong interest in programming and data science. With the eyetracking work in particular, I have developed software for efficiently processing and visualizing the data in R [http://github.com/jashubbard/itrackR]. I also developed and taught an undergraduate crash course in programming with Python for Psychology students [blogs.uoregon.edu/psycomputing](http://blogs.uoregon.edu/psycomputing).
Prior to arriving at UO, I received a Masters degree in the Psychological Research program at San Francisco State University. There I worked in Ezequiel Morsella’s Action and Consciousness Lab, where I conducted a variety of research projects related to executive control and action, and their relationships with subjective experience. These included examinations in the dynamics between multiple items held in working memory, anticipatory responses in ideomotor processing, and the subjective effects of random experience, among other topics.
