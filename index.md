title: About me
---

I am  a doctoral candidate at the University of Oregon, working in Ulrich Mayr’s Cognitive Dynamics Lab. I investigate the mechanisms underlying executive control and decision making, and the  ways that these processes change in healthy aging. I also do work in Neuroeconomics, specifically investigating the motivations that drive altruistic behavior, and how they are reflected in brain activity ([paper](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2016-39037-001/)).
I enjoy the opportunity to employ diverse methods in my work, having experience with behavioral experiments, eyetracking, pupillometry, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), structural MRI, functional MRI, cardiac measures, and EEG. I also utilize a breadth of statistical and analytic techniques to these data, including multilevel modelling with fixations, latent variable analyses (SEM) with fMRI, and most recently machine learning with EEG. This is borne out of my interests in programming and data science. With my eyetracking work, I have developed software for efficiently processing and visualizing the data in R [github.com/jashubbard/itrackR](http://github.com/jashubbard/itrackR). I also developed and taught an undergraduate crash course in programming with Python for Psychology students [blogs.uoregon.edu/psycomputing](http://blogs.uoregon.edu/psycomputing).
Prior to arriving at UO, I received a Masters degree in the Psychological Research program at San Francisco State University. There I worked in Ezequiel Morsella’s Action and Consciousness Lab, where I conducted a variety of research projects related to executive control and action, and their relation with subjective experience. These included examinations into the dynamics between multiple representations held in working memory, anticipatory responses in ideomotor processing, and the subjective effects of random experience, among other topics.
