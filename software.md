Much of my work has dealt with analyzing eye tracking data and pupillometry. from SR Research Eyelink eye trackers.
There are not many open-source options for analyzing these data, so I decided to make my own packages. I started with Matlab, but have moved on to R as my main environment. I plan on producing a Python package as well. 

-   edfR – an R package for basic importing of data from Eyelink eye
    trackers <https://github.com/jashubbard/edfR>

-   itrackR – an R package for high-level analysis of eye tracking data
    from Eyelink eye trackers <https://github.com/jashubbard/itrackR>
    
-   iTrack – a Matlab package for high-level analysis of eye tracking
    data from Eyelink eye trackers
    <https://github.com/jashubbard/iTrack>
